# MLTermProjectDataset
This is the Dataset Repository for the Machine Learning and Information Visualization Term Project for my coursework at Virginia Tech

I have created a dash app for the visualization of the data.(Part of Information Vizualization) <br> 
**Data Cleaning tab:** helps you clean the data and shows the steps to clean and preprocess the data.<br> 
**Statisitc Tab:** It is for the Normality Tests and I added 3 of the Normality Tests KS_Test, Shapiro Test and D'Augustino Pearson Test for Normality of the data.<br> 
**Correlation and Covariance Tab:** Its for displaying the correlation or covariance matrix on the basis of a subset of columns.<br> 
**Complex Plots:** These are the complex plots which I created to depict the data.<br>
